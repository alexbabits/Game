Swapping items is an extra feature added after everything is correct.

Whenever a drag and drop event occurs in InventoryDisplay, it simply notifies InventoryData about the change. For example, when an item is moved from one slot to another, InventoryDisplay could call a method in InventoryData like moveItem(oldSlotIndex, newSlotIndex). The moveItem function would then update the internal game state to reflect the change.

The key is to ensure that InventoryDisplay doesn't directly manipulate the game state -- it just passes the relevant information to InventoryData, which is responsible for actually making the changes. This approach maintains the separation of concerns between the two classes: one for display and user interaction, and one for managing the data.





equipItem function in inventory, since its currently in the inventory (items array)
unequipItem function in equipment, since its currently in the equipment (equip array).
The only player aspect of a method like usePotion is incrementing the players HP. Therefore, the InventoryData will need a reference to the player.
