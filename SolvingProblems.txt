• (Bug) New/Saving/Loading (One Player/Slot):

HomeScene should have (New, Load, Options, Quit) that functions as expected. (Quit just exits Electron).
In Game Menu should have (Save/Load/Quit to Main Menu) that functions as expected.

For multiple save slots, the load scene should popup showing which ones.
The loadscene popup is exactly the same in the StartScreen as it is in game.

Currently, loading only done from menu.js. Tried loading with load button in StartScreen, but things got messy because not everything was loaded yet.


(Load Button, first checks if a game state exists, perhaps handled by a 'LoadScene' screen which pops up the slots (Just 1 at first).)


If no saved game state exists, all the slots would be blank and not show anything.
If the saved file is corrupted or not available, make a try-catch block when calling loadFromFile() and providing appropriate user feedback could be a good idea.


• (Refactor/Bug) Preload everything in some central location (Fix Inventory Sprites loading in after.)
