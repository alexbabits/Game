Multiple save slots:

For multiple save slots, the load scene should popup showing which ones. The loadscene popup is exactly the same in the StartScreen as it is in game.

Checks for Load Button:
Load Button, first checks if a game state exists, perhaps handled by a 'LoadScene' screen which pops up the slots (Just 1 at first). If no saved game state exists, all the slots would be blank and not show anything. If the saved file is corrupted or not available, make a try-catch block when calling loadFromFile() and providing appropriate user feedback could be a good idea.
