Within same session:
    1. New Game isn't always a new game. If play game, click New ---> Do stuff/Save ---> Quit ---> New, it's not a new game. (Within the same session).
    2. Save and Load works perfect within same session, even with quitting back to StartScreen or not.


Different sessions:
    1. New works as intended, always starting a completely fresh game.
    2. Load and Save still work as intended.


Problems:
    1. New game needs to make a new game always, even within same session.
    2. Load functionality currently only within game menu in game. Needs to be functional on start screen as well.
    3. (Refactor/Bug) Preload everything in some central location (Fix Inventory Sprites loading in after.)



File concerns:

Core: GameState.js, Maps.js, StartScreen.js, Menu.js
Peripheral: main.js, preload.js, Configs.js, Player.js, InventoryData.js, EquipmentData.js





















Back Burner:
For multiple save slots, the load scene should popup showing which ones. The loadscene popup is exactly the same in the StartScreen as it is in game.


Load Button, first checks if a game state exists, perhaps handled by a 'LoadScene' screen which pops up the slots (Just 1 at first). If no saved game state exists, all the slots would be blank and not show anything. If the saved file is corrupted or not available, make a try-catch block when calling loadFromFile() and providing appropriate user feedback could be a good idea.
