New/Saving/Loading work smoothly for one player, for homescene and in game. (Load scene popup is same in HomeScene and in game for example.)

Add game load method in your HomeScene.js instead of menu.js. Check if a saved game state exists. If no saved game state exists, this option could either be grayed out or display a message to the user saying that no saved games were found. Handle errors and edge cases - if the saved file is corrupted or not available, make a try-catch block when calling loadFromFile() and providing appropriate user feedback could be a good idea.
