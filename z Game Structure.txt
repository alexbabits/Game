*****Game/Scene Structure*****

StartScreen - New, Load, Options, Quit

    - Graphcis: Contains graphics settings

Game Menu - Save, Load, Options, Resume, Quit
    - Save: Allows you to save a game to whatever 'load slot' you are currently in, it could prompt the loadscene to pop up, asking which slot to save to.
    - Load: Same LoadScene as the StartScreen's Load.
    - Options: Same Options as at the StartScreen's Options.
    - Resume: Just resumes back to current map and everything.
    - Quit: Goes back to StartScreen.

Game - Death, Maps
    - Death: DeathScene is fine as it is. Should simply take you back to main menu, making sure everything is clear and ready for New/Load game.
    - Maps: Should have current gamestate of the player and everything neccessary between maps. Maps talk to eachother with their data?
