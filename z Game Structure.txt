*****Game/Scene Structure*****

StartScreen - New, Load, Options, Quit
    - New grabs default gamestate as if player is starting a new game.
    - Load pops up LoadScene, allowing to load a game.
    - Options pops up the Options Scene.
    - Quit exits Electron

Options - Controls, Audio, Graphics, ???
    - Controls contains controls/keybinds (customizable in future)
    - Audio contains audio settings
    - Graphcis contains graphics settings

Menu - Save, Load, Options, Resume, Quit to Main, Quit Entirely 
    - Save allows you to save a game to whatever 'load slot' you are currently in, it could prompt the loadscene to pop up, asking which slot to save to.
    - Load scene exactly the same as StartScreen, just pick one and load it.
    - Options also the same
    - Resume just resumes back to current map and everything.
    - Quit goes back to StartScreen, quit entirely exits electron.

Game - Death, Maps
    - On death, what happens? Death scene and then... idk?
    - Maps should have current gamestate of the player and everything neccessary between maps. Maps talk to eachother with their data?
