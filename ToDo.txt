--> Player XP Bars. Monster Status Bars. (For monsters, their health still goes negative, need getter/setter like in player class to fix.)
--> (First, display all the monster HP bars, and then say in the monster aggressive or attack state, then only show relevant ones then)

--> Looting Scene pop-up window (with enemy item drops)

--> Inventory (Slots, and then brown bag background to make it look nice)

--> Bank (Need chest in game to click on and bank stuff). Store (Need NPC or chest in game to click on and view store menu.)

--> Pause Menu/Controls(Esc key brings up menu options (Load, Save, Options, Esc, etc.) (Options --> Audio/Keybinds/Graphics etc.))

--> (Load/Save) Need all proper things in GameState, and make sure that works (Invy/Bank/Monsters/Location/etc.)

--> Overall 'Maps.js' parent class for all the maps. (And perhaps a GameState.js which houses common 'states' of the player and game progress we want.)

--> Equipment Scene, have an enlarged idling animation of the player on the equip screen, like runescape, and gear slots, and stats on the right. Have small button next to inventory bag with helmet and sword indicating that player can click and that also takes you to equipment scene.

--> Teleporter: =-D

--> Chatbox for console messages.

--> "Grim Reaper picture on Game Over Scene, Press any button to continue" New scene when player dies. If button is pressed, takes back to home screen of 'New/Load/Save/Exit'.

--> (Small Bug): Multiple Monsters running like idiots at you, pushing you around and not respecting the attackSensor as a stopping place sometimes.

--> (Bonus): For enemy attacking, instead of the timer starting and then waiting 1 second and then performing first attack, have the first attack always be instant at the first instant of touching the player collider and the monster attack sensor, and then start the timer. (Later on making it based off frames just like player attacking could be best.)
--> (Bonus): Click to move/arrow keys to move, also zoom scroll with mouse wheel.
--> (Bonus): Defense stat on monsters & player
--> (Bonus): Debuffs and buffs.
--> (Bonus): Random % Chance for 'hero_crit' critical with that anim. And then a separate animation and stuff for 'hero_special' for special attacks. 
--> (Bonus): Combine PlayerAttackState and PlayerSpecialAttackState.
--> (Bonus): You can only save at the inn when you go to sleep.
--> (Bonus): Monster 'wandering' while in idle state? Or new 'wander' state.
--> (Future Bug): Multiple mosnters spawn at once if you exit to map2 and back to map1. Also, game crashes if monster hits you after coming back to map1.
--> (Small Bonus): Can load in the monsters in a more streamlined manner with MonsterManager probably.
--> (Small Bug): You can 'cheese' the running system and tap shift very fast while moving to conserve stamina. Perhaps a cooldown for the transition.
--> (Small Bonus): Change all Bars into parent class.

***Future Stuff*** Weapons/Sensors/Animations/Sprites:

--> 2 different kinds of weapons. (Different colors on same weapon). Different base damages for each weapon

Sensors: You just have many different sensors on the player (dagger distance sensor, spear distance sensors, Up, Down, Left, and Right sensors. It's just that they are not all activated at once. The 'dagger distance sensor left' is only activated when the player is facing to the left with a dagger for example.)
(For now we just always have sword = true or whatever, so it always has it working.)

Animations/Sprites: May need tons (Left/Right = Mirror, Down = separate, Up = separate). How to contend with wearing armor and weapon sprites?

Armor and Gear:
As you mentioned, changing armor doesn't necessarily mean changing animations, but it does change the appearance of the character sprite. One method is to have separate sprite sheets for each armor set, with all the necessary animations (walk, run, attack, etc). This is quite labor-intensive but gives the most visually impressive results.

For weapons, you can have separate animations for each weapon type, such as swinging a sword versus swinging an axe. Another way to simplify this is by using "paper dolling" techniques. In this method, you separate the weapon from the character, allowing it to be drawn independently. Then you can define a "hand" position in your character animation, and draw the weapon at that position with its own animation. This way, you can mix and match different weapon animations with the same character animation.

Each piece of gear or equipment (head, chest, legs, etc.) would be its own separate sprite or sprite sheet. These are layered on top of a base character sprite, which has its own set of animations (walking, running, etc.). The individual gear sprites can be static (not animated), or they can have their own animations that match up with the base character animations. When the gear is equipped, its sprite is added to the character's sprite at the appropriate layer and position.

To make this work, the artist needs to ensure that all the gear sprites align correctly with the base character sprite and its animations. For example, if the character raises their arm during an attack animation, there needs to be an equivalent 'raised arm' sprite for every piece of gear that could be equipped in the 'arm' slot.







Creation of Bars: Each bar (HealthBar, ManaBar, etc.) can indeed inherit from a parent class Bars. The Bars class should contain methods and properties that are common to all types of bars, such as the width, height, position, and perhaps some method for updating the display. This can include creating the visual element (like a rectangle or sprite), updating its size, color or other properties, and adding it to the scene.

PlayerBars and MonsterBars: As you said, it does make sense to separate the logic for PlayerBars and MonsterBars as their behavior might be different. For instance, MonsterBars might only include health, while PlayerBars could have health, mana, stamina and experience. Each of these classes (PlayerBars and MonsterBars) could have methods for creating, updating and destroying the individual bars. They would then instantiate the individual bar classes (HealthBar, ManaBar, etc.) as needed.

Updating Bars: You'll need to have methods in your individual bar classes (HealthBar, ManaBar, etc.) to update the visual representation of the bar based on the current value of the corresponding attribute (like health or mana). This might involve scaling the width of the bar, changing its color, etc.

Integration with Player and Monster Classes: You'll also need a way to integrate these bars with your Player and Monster classes. The Player and Monster classes should have a reference to their corresponding PlayerBars and MonsterBars instance, and should update these whenever relevant attributes (like health or mana) change.

Visibility of Bars: For a better user experience, you might want to only show the Monster's HealthBar when the monster is being attacked or is in the player's field of vision. Similarly, the Player's bars could become semi-transparent or change in some way when they're full to not distract from the gameplay.

I think you have a good plan. Once you begin implementing, you'll be able to refine this structure based on the specifics of your game.
