--> GameState.js which houses games current state, allows for loading/saving, and has current state of player/monsters/npcs/items/etc.

************************************************************************************************************************************************************

--> Inventory (Slots, and then brown bag background to make it look nice)
--> Usable Items (Put potion in bag, allow player to double click to use, hover over the potion gives a tooltip (hp pot, str pot, etc.))
--> Looting Scene pop-up window (with enemy item drops)
--> Bank (Need chest in game to click on and bank stuff). Store (Need NPC or chest in game to click on and view store menu.)
--> Pause Menu/Controls(Esc key brings up menu options (Load, Save, Options, Esc, etc.) (Options --> Audio/Keybinds/Graphics etc.))
--> Equipment Scene, have an enlarged idling animation of the player on the equip screen, like runescape, and gear slots, and stats on the right. Have small button next to inventory bag with helmet and sword indicating that player can click and that also takes you to equipment scene. (Hover over equipment gives stats)
--> Teleporter: =-D
--> Chatbox for console messages.
--> Loading Bar scene after the homescene that loads in assets.

--> (Bonus): Hitsplats on player and monster
--> (Bonus): Monster Attack Anims
--> (Bonus): Click to move/Click to initiate attack?
--> (Bonus): Monster Spawn zones instead of just random points. Would be same dimensions as their wander zone.
--> (Bonus): Monster 'wandering' while in idle state? Or new 'wander' state.
--> (Bonus): Defense stat on monsters & player.
--> (Bonus): Debuffs and buffs.
--> (Bonus): Random % Chance for critical (no anim change, besides hitsplats), would work with both attack and special attack. Along with crit efficiency (150% etc.)
--> (Bonus): You can only save at the inn when you go to sleep.
--> (Bonus): Player and/or monster damage is random (from 0 to maxDamage basically)
--> (Bonus): Monster Attacking Sensor is not a circle but more closely related to their body shape.

--> (Optional): Combine PlayerAttackState and PlayerSpecialAttackState.
--> (Optional): Refactor player stats/methods into a separate file? Player class is messy with its stats and methods.

--> (Small Bug): Fix status bar positions during camera zooming.
--> (Small Bug): Multiple Monsters running like idiots at you, pushing you around and not respecting the attackSensor as a stopping place sometimes.
--> (Small Bug): If you aggro two enemies at once, only one will follow you. (Similar to how if you ran away from two monsters attack range quickly, only 1 would transition to attack state).
--> (Small Bug): Player facing wrong way when entering map. Handle direction in gamestate.


Monsters/GameState Thoughts:

Currently: Destroys all monsters & references to monsters, and creates them again when you go back to a scene. Working fine.

GameState: When the player leaves a scene by dying or simply walking to a new scene, the game would take a snapshot of the monsters current state when the player leaves the scene, and saves each monster's, dead or alive, current state which includes their attributes including hp, other stats, position, isAlive flag, etc. Then, if the player re-enters the scene, it would grab that snapshot and load in the data for each monster. ID may be needed for GameState. 

The whole purpose of this would be if the player has killed some of the monsters in a scene, if he exits the scene and comes back, only the monsters that are still alive are loaded back in, while the others are still waiting for their respawn timer so they can spawn back in. Would also want to force the alive monsters HP to be full again to prevent cheesing.

May not need full-blown "MonsterState" class with getters and setters for every attribute. You could create a "MonsterData" class that simply stores the necessary information about a monster (type, health, position, respawn timer, etc.) in a serializable format. When the player leaves a scene, you could create a MonsterData object for each monster in the scene and store these in an array. When the player re-enters the scene, you could use these MonsterData objects to recreate the monsters in their previous state. You would need to modify your Monster and MonsterManager classes to support creating monsters from MonsterData objects, and ensure that all relevant monster information is correctly saved and loaded.


Weapon/Armor Sprite and Animation:

--> Different sprites and animations for different weapons. Start with sword and axe, and two colors of each. Different base damages for each weapon.
--> Weapon range distance can be dealt by by turning off and on sensors like you have done for the 'Direction'. It is possible to combine many sensors onto the player and only turn on the ones you want. Also up/down/left/right sensors rather than just left/right. You would have up/down/left/right sensors, and then also a specific weapon sensor which is basically a rectangle, or other shape, with a specific length for that weapon range.
--> Contend with armor wearing using the paper dolling technique. Changing armor doesn't necessarily mean changing animations, but it does change the appearance of the character sprite. Each piece of gear or equipment (head, chest, legs, etc.) would be its own separate sprite or sprite sheet. These are layered on top of a base character sprite, which has its own set of animations (walking, running, etc.). The individual gear sprites can be static (not animated), or they can have their own animations that match up with the base character animations. When the gear is equipped, its sprite is added to the character's sprite at the appropriate layer and position.
--> Contend with weapon wielding sprites by having separate animations for each weapon type.
--> Paper dolling: Separate the weapon from the character, allowing it to be drawn independently. Then you can define a "hand" position in your character animation, and draw the weapon at that position with its own animation. This way, you can mix and match different weapon animations with the same character animation. To make this work, the artist needs to ensure that all the gear sprites align correctly with the base character sprite and its animations. For example, if the character raises their arm during an attack animation, there needs to be an equivalent 'raised arm' sprite for every piece of gear that could be equipped in the 'arm' slot.


Inventory:

inventoryData: This will be a 2D array that represents the state of the inventory. Each element of the array will be an object that contains information about the item in the corresponding slot. If a slot is empty, the corresponding element in the array will be null or some other value that represents an empty slot. Here's an example of what inventoryData might look like:

3. addItem: This method will be responsible for adding an item to the inventory. It will take the itemName, frame, and quantity as parameters. It will then add this item to the inventoryData. If the slot where the item is supposed to go is already occupied, it will find the next available slot and put the item there. If there are no available slots, it will print a message saying the inventory is full. The addItem method will need to find an available slot to add an item. This could be done in a simple way by iterating over the inventoryData until it finds an empty slot. If there are no empty slots, it will print a message saying the inventory is full.

4. drawInventoryItems: This method will be responsible for updating the visual representation of the inventory. It will go through the inventoryData and for each item, it will draw the corresponding sprite in the correct slot and display the quantity. If a slot is empty, it will make sure there is no sprite or quantity text displayed for that slot. The drawInventoryItems method will also iterate over the inventoryData, but instead of looking for an empty slot, it will draw a sprite and display a quantity for each item it finds.

5. Implement the removeItem method: Implement the removeItem method to remove an item from the inventoryData. This will involve updating the inventoryData and the visual representation of the inventory.

6. Implement the moveItem method: Implement the moveItem method to allow items to be moved between slots. This will involve updating both the inventoryData and the visual representation of the inventory.

7. Implement the getInventoryData and setInventoryData methods: These methods will be used to save and load the inventory state. getInventoryData should return the current inventoryData, and setInventoryData should update the inventoryData and the visual representation of the inventory to match the given data.

8. Implement the saveInventoryState and loadInventoryState methods in the GameState: These methods will call getInventoryData and setInventoryData to save and load the inventory state when transitioning between scenes.

9. Test the inventory system: Finally, test the inventory system by adding, removing, and moving items, and by transitioning between scenes to make sure the inventory state is correctly saved and loaded.

Remember to take it one step at a time, and test each part thoroughly before moving on to the next.
