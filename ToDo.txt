*****Bug Fixes/Refactoring*****
• (Bug) Stackable consumables only re-load in as quantity 1 on New Game if used beforehand within the same session.
• (Bug) Multiple Monsters running at you, pushing you/them around and not respecting the attackSensor as a stopping place sometimes.
• (Refactor) Combine PlayerAttackState and PlayerSpecialAttackState?
• (Refactor) Make Player stats/methods better. New files maybe.
• (Refactor) Make Inventory and Equipment Better.


*****New Features/Improvements on Current Features*****
• Tooltips for items displaying stats/enchants/description, in inventory/equipment/loot scenes.
• Tooltips for stats/abilities w/ descriptions.
• Right click drop to removeInvItem, or some way to delete, handle case when inventory is full. Can't loot if invy is full.
• Dragging item from equipment slot into inventory slot, as another way to unequip besides double click. (Also deal with stackables)
• Dragging item from inventory slot into equipment slot, as another way to equip besides double click. (Also deal with stackables)
• Dragging item from loot slot into inventory, as another way to loot besides single click. (Also deal with stackables)
• Monster Attacking Sensor chamfered rectangle instead of circle. (Issues with aggro/attacking state then based on width rather than radius)
• Monster Attack Anims. Monster Death Anims. If dead body, final frame gets paused.
• Clicking/walkover dead body/lootbag/chest on ground to loot, loot scene appears. (Body/Loot Scene stay for 60 sec, then monster respawn and it disappears.)
• Increased inventory size (16 --> 64). 4 pages of it?
• Bank (Need chest in game to click on and bank stuff). Gold currency.
• Store (Need NPC or chest in game to click on and view store menu.). Gold currency.
• Quests & Interactions with NPCs. Chatbox for NPCs.
• Spells Staves (Spell like DS3, pyromancer hand with flames can be equipped in offhand/mainhand.) (spell hand = weak, wand = medium, 2H staff = strong)
• Debuffs (from monsters). Buffs from unique potions/items/gear/altars.
• Stat resets. Drink from the forgetfullness well or fountain. Or a fairy lets you unlearn everything.
• Monster Spawn 'zones' instead of 'random points'. Random Respawn/Spawn be same dimensions as their wander zone.
• Monster 'wandering' while in idle state? Or new 'wander' state.
• TimePlayed Stat for Journal. (Initialize, start timer, pause timer, update game state set/getTimePlayed, housed in player stats.)
• Spritesheet for each weapon type, and for armor. And maybe colors for different ones if feeling ambitious.
• 4 way direction instead of 2 way direction for monsters and player animations.
• Multiple saves, links to correct slot when player does new/save game. 'save' button automatically save to correct slot. If full, user must overwrite/delete one.
• Instead of 640x640, game configs to fullscreen, and on electron startup.
• GameState for the current zoom, saved between scene transitions and loads. Perhaps just linked with the player or some already existing game state 'chunk'.
• Messages from MessageBox aren't persisting like the rest of the message box sprites (due to them being 'complex' in an array).
• Options functionality (Audio, Graphics, Controls)
• Caves/Special locations/Quest Icons added to the WorldMap.
• Key 'E' or something to autoloot (Just done from the lootScene). 'Loot' header text and make it look nice as well. (Same for invy and equipment)
• Different stamina amounts and special attack mana amounts for different weapons.
• On new map loadup, the text gets reset for messagebox which is fine, but should print out the region the player is currently in, like 'Jakkeen Fields'.
• Weapons/Damage/Regens scale dynamically with stats in a better way.
• Stat Requirements to wield Weapons/Armor/Spells. (INT, AGI, STR).
• Make Crit Chance and Crit Damage actually proc. no special anim change for crits/dodges


*****Undecided Features*****
• Caps lock toggles run, in addition to the current shift-hold mechanism.
• Hotkey/action bar
• Combat and movement as turn-based/tick based.
• Player and/or monster damage is random (from 0 to maxDamage basically)
• Click to move/Click to attack
• Potion cooldown timer, and ticker/hourglass icon that displays top of screen (20s cooldown that ticks down). (Similar to WOW cooldown graphics)
• NSIS for the installer, makes it so always creates desktop shortcut. (Otherwise have to uninstall if made the dist build more than once)

*****GOAL*****
Publish demo game on itch.io basically, with all the basics covered above, or to game dev discord. Or phaser discord, etc.
