Add game load method in your HomeScene.js instead of menu.js. Check if a saved game state exists. If no saved game state exists, this option could either be grayed out or display a message to the user saying that no saved games were found. Handle errors and edge cases - if the saved file is corrupted or not available, make a try-catch block when calling loadFromFile() and providing appropriate user feedback could be a good idea.
