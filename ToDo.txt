*****Bug Fixes/Refactoring*****
• (Bug) Stackable consumables only re-load in as quantity 1 on New Game if used beforehand within the same session.
• (Bug) Multiple Monsters running at you, pushing you/them around and not respecting the attackSensor as a stopping place sometimes.
• (Refactor) Combine PlayerAttackState and PlayerSpecialAttackState?
• (Refactor) Combine player stats/methods into a separate file? Player class is messy with its stats and methods.


*****New Features/Improvements on Current Features*****

• Swap items when equipping one of the same type. (Weapon1 --> Weapon2). Should allow for new equipment to be equipped.
• Swap items in inventory.

• Make stats do things. Crit Chance/Crit Damge/Dodge/etc. (no special anim change for crits/dodges) (Make them based on str/agil/weapons/armor/etc.). 

• Dragging item from equipment slot into inventory, as another way to unequip besides double click. (Also deal with stackables)
• Dragging item into equipment slot, as another way to equip besides double click. (Also deal with stackables)
• Dragging item from loot slot into inventory, as another way to loot besides single click. (Also deal with stackables)


• Tooltips for items displaying stats/enchants/description, in inventory/equipment/loot scenes.
• Tooltips for stats/abilities w/ descriptions.

• Right click drop to removeInvItem, or some way to delete, handle case when inventory is full. Can't loot if invy is full.
• Increased inventory size (16 --> 64). 4 pages of it?

• Monster Attacking Sensor chamfered rectangle instead of circle. (Issues with aggro/attacking state then based on width rather than radius)
• Monster Attack Anims. Monster Death Anims. Mechanism for clicking dead body/lootbag/chest on the ground to loot. Or on Click/walkover the loot scene appears.


• Bank (Need chest in game to click on and bank stuff). Gold currency.
• Store (Need NPC or chest in game to click on and view store menu.). Gold currency.
• Quests & Interactions with NPCs. Chatbox for NPCs.
• Spells Staves (Spell like DS3, pyromancer hand with flames can be equipped in offhand/mainhand.)

• Debuffs (from monsters). Buffs from unique potions/items/gear/altars.
• Stat resets. Drink from the forgetfullness well or fountain. Or a fairy lets you unlearn everything.
• Monster Spawn 'zones' instead of 'random points'. Random Respawn/Spawn be same dimensions as their wander zone.
• Monster 'wandering' while in idle state? Or new 'wander' state.
• TimePlayed Stat for Journal. (Initialize, start timer, pause timer, update game state set/getTimePlayed, housed in player stats.)
• Spritesheet for each weapon type, and for armor. And maybe colors for different ones if feeling ambitious.
• 4 way direction instead of 2 way direction for monsters and player animations.
• Multiple saves, links to correct slot when player does new/save game. 'save' button automatically save to correct slot. If full, user must overwrite/delete one.
• Instead of 640x640, game configs to fullscreen, and on electron startup.
• GameState for the current zoom, saved between scene transitions and loads. Perhaps just linked with the player or some already existing game state 'chunk'.
• Messages from MessageBox aren't persisting like the rest of the message box.
• Options functionality (Audio, Graphics, Controls)
• Caves/Special locations/Quest Icons added to the WorldMap.


*****Undecided Features*****
• Caps lock toggles run, in addition to the current shift-hold mechanism.
• Hotkey/action bar
• Combat and movement as turn-based/tick based.
• Player and/or monster damage is random (from 0 to maxDamage basically)
• Click to move/Click to attack
• Potion cooldown timer, and ticker/hourglass icon that displays top of screen (20s cooldown that ticks down). (Similar to WOW cooldown graphics)
• NSIS for the installer, makes it so always creates desktop shortcut. (Otherwise have to uninstall if made the dist build more than once)

*****GOAL*****
Publish demo game on itch.io basically, with all the basics covered above, or to game dev discord.
