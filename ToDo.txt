*****Bug Fixes/Refactoring*****
• (Bug) Stackable consumables only re-load in as quantity 1 on New Game if used beforehand within the same session.
• (Bug) Multiple Monsters running like idiots at you, pushing you around and not respecting the attackSensor as a stopping place sometimes.
• (Bug) Inventory item sprites and Controls background occassionally not loading in properly. (On first startup via .exe, after map loads once it's fine.)
• (Refactor) Combine PlayerAttackState and PlayerSpecialAttackState?
• (Refactor) Combine player stats/methods into a separate file? Player class is messy with its stats and methods.


*****New Features/Improvements on Current Features*****
• Multiple saves, links to correct slot when player does new/save game. 'save' button automatically save to correct slot. If full, user must overwrite/delete one.
• Delete buttons to delete the save file.
• Preload all assets in some central location. BootScene perhaps? Ask GPT if that makes sense.
• Level up mechanics (golden confetti, then stats choices to increase max stats)
• Chatbox for console messages. Chatbox for NPCs. (For chatbox, try making the text not blurry with bitmap or whatever)
• XP drops
• X button for inventory/equipment/loot scenes. Bag/equipment icon to open/close inventory too.
• Hitsplats on player and monster
• Defense stat on monsters. Player damage on monster adjusted properly.
• Swap items when equipping one of the same type. (Weapon1 --> Weapon2). Should allow for new equipment to be equipped.
• Increased inventory size (16 --> 64). 4 pages of it?
• Map (M key for Map)
• Minimap
• J for journal/Quests
• Teleporter. Allows for movement between scenes. Animated.

• Caps lock toggles run, in addition to the current shift-hold mechanism.
• Instead of 640x640, game configs to fullscreen, and on electron startup.
• Dragging item from equipment slot into inventory, as another way to unequip besides double click. (Also deal with stackables)
• Dragging item into equipment slot, as another way to equip besides double click. (Also deal with stackables)
• Tooltips for items displaying stats/enchants/description, in inventory/equipment/loot scenes.
• Tooltips for stats/abilities w/ descriptions.
• Monster Attacking Sensor chamfered rectangle instead of circle. (Issues with aggro/attacking state then based on width rather than radius)
• Monster Attack Anims. Monster Death Anims. Mechanism for clicking dead body/lootbag/chest on the ground to loot. Or on Click/walkover the loot scene appears.
• Crit Chance %/Crit Damge %/Dodge/Accuracy/etc. (MORE STATS) (no anim change for crits/dodges, besides hitsplats).

• Bank (Need chest in game to click on and bank stuff). Gold currency.

• Quests & Interactions with NPCs.
• Monster Spawn 'zones' instead of 'random points'. Random Respawn/Spawn be same dimensions as their wander zone.
• Monster 'wandering' while in idle state? Or new 'wander' state.
• Stat resets. Drink from the forgetfullness well or fountain. Or a fairy lets you unlearn everything.
• Weapon Type property for the items object. (Sword, Shield, Chest, helm, Axe, etc.)
• Spritesheet for each weapon type, and for armor. And maybe colors for different ones if feeling ambitious.
• 4 way direction instead of 2 way direction for monsters and player animations.
• Hide Inventory and Equipment when game is paused, if they are open, rather than just making them inactive.
• Some form of a loading scene (Loading Bar, Spinning Icon, etc.). Only when game gets heavy enough.

• Player and/or monster damage is random (from 0 to maxDamage basically)
