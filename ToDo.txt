Add game load method in your HomeScene.js instead of menu.js. Check if a saved game state exists. If no saved game state exists, this option could either be grayed out or display a message to the user saying that no saved games were found. Handle errors and edge cases - if the saved file is corrupted or not available, make a try-catch block when calling loadFromFile() and providing appropriate user feedback could be a good idea.


*****Bug Fixes/Refactoring*****
• (Bug) New/Saving/Loading work smoothly for one player, for homescene and in game. (Load scene popup is same in HomeScene and in game for example.)
• (Refactor/Bug) Preload everything in some central location (Fix Inventory Sprites loading in after.)
• (Refactor) Combine PlayerAttackState and PlayerSpecialAttackState?
• (Refactor) Combine player stats/methods into a separate file? Player class is messy with its stats and methods.
• (Bug) Player gets double bonus sometimes when save/loading with/without equipment?
• (Bug) Multiple Monsters running like idiots at you, pushing you around and not respecting the attackSensor as a stopping place sometimes.
• (Bug) If you aggro two enemies at once, only one will follow you.
• (Bug) If you exit aggro range of two enemies at once, only one will follow you (Fixed, what was fix?)
• (Bug) Can equip/use things while in pause mode in menu.
• (Bug) On death if respawn, you get damage/defense as if you were equipping your stuff twice.
